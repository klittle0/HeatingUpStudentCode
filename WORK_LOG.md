| 1/13 |  2:40-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I brainstormed with the class to come up with an algorithm. We decided to use a recursive technique similar to Moksha Patam and create a 2nd array that tracks the length of the sequence up until a certain day/temperature. |
| 1/13 |  4:45-5:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I wrote pseudocode then coded my first rough implementation. Currently, my program returns a length of 0 for all test cases. |
| 1/15 | 10:00-10:40am |                                                                                                  I used a print statement to determine that I'm never updating my span length, and I think it's because I never update my max Start, so I went through my code to update the variable. I also modified my recursive method because my final temperature wasn't being counted, and that fixed one of my biggest problems. Now, my code works for the first 3 and final test cases, but times out for the 4th one. |
| 1/15 |  1:00-1:45pm  | GOAL: Keep track of certain values throughout to reduce the redundant recursive calls throughout. I discovered that my startMax variable should be a startMin, so I modified my code to reduce cases of recursion. I also updated my recursive case so that it keeps track of the smallest move, so that it never recurses to a temperature that's higher than one it's already recursed to. This reduced the runtime for the 4 cases that were already working, but it's still too slow for TestEfficientLarge. |
