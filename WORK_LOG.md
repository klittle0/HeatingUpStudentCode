| 1/13 |  2:40-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I brainstormed with the class to come up with an algorithm. We decided to use a recursive technique similar to Moksha Patam and create a 2nd array that tracks the length of the sequence up until a certain day/temperature. |
| 1/13 |  4:45-5:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I wrote pseudocode then coded my first rough implementation. Currently, my program returns a length of 0 for all test cases. |
| 1/15 | 10:00-10:40am |                                                                                                                                             I used a print statement to determine that I'm never updating my span length, and I think it's because I never update my max Start, so I went through my code to update the variable. I also modified my recursive method because my final temperature wasn't being counted, and that fixed one of my biggest problems. Now, my code works for the first 3 and final test cases, but times out for the 4th one. |
| 1/15 |  1:00-1:45pm  |                                            GOAL: Keep track of certain values throughout to reduce the redundant recursive calls throughout. I discovered that my startMax variable should be a startMin, so I modified my code to reduce cases of recursion. I also updated my recursive case so that it keeps track of the smallest move, so that it never recurses to a temperature that's higher than one it's already recursed to. This reduced the runtime for the 4 cases that were already working, but it's still too slow for TestEfficientLarge. |
| 1/21 |  7:20-8:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I began implementing the Heating Up theory. I finished the primary method but am still drafting my recursive method to find individual max spans. I have not tried the test cases yet. |
| 1/22 | 9:15-10:00am  | Only the first test case works. I added a print statement to my code & discovered that for some reason, the span of each temperature is just its index + 1. I realized that it's because I was comparing the indices of my temperatures rather than the temperatures themselves. After fixing this, all of my test cases work except for the test efficient large, which returns 19 instead of 62. Mr. Blick helped me look through my recursive method & realize that I don't have the proper base case to exit early if a temperature is already visited. |
