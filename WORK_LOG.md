We decided to use a recursive technique similar to Moksha Patam and create a 2nd array that tracks the length of the sequence up until a certain day/temperature. |

Currently, my program returns a length of 0 for all test cases. |
| 1/15 | 10:00-10:40am | I used a print statement to determine that I'm never updating my span length, and I think it's because I never update my max Start, so I went through my code to update the variable. I also modified my recursive method because my final temperature wasn't being counted, and that fixed one of my biggest problems. Now, my code works for the first 3 test cases, but fails the last one and times out for the 4th one. |
